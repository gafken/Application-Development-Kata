# Application-Development-Kata

This will only run on Windows (Sorry about that!  I shoulld've made it with .Net Core but I wanted to try out the Web API 2 Controller.  It's much nicer, for the record.)

The only steps to run the Unit Tests is to Clone the Repo and you can simply execute the Tests in Visual Studios 2017.
